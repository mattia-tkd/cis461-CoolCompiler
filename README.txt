TYPECHECKER ASSIGNMENT

To build, run make.
To run the parser, run parse <filename>. Use parse -dp to output
	debugging information regarding parsing.
	
To visualize the generated abstract syntax tree, run
	tree <filename>
The tree will be created in a file called out.pdf.
Use tree -dt <filename> to output debugging information regarding the typechecker.

Graphviz must be installed for the tree command to work.

The tree will contain type information generated by the parser.
