I am starting a string "right now, and it is going to have \"some quotes and stuff\" in it, maybe even a blackslash like this \\"
"This string has some special characters in it \n a new line \t a tab \f a form-feed and\b a backspace."
"This string has some non-special escaped characters like an \a and a \c"
"This string has an escaped \
newline."
"This string has a non-escaped
newline, which isn't allowed."
